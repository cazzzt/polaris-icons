# Polaris icons

> The Polaris icons project helps developers and designers to use and contribute to the collection of icons that we use across the Shopify platform, as a part of the [Polaris design system](https://polaris.shopify.com/).

## Getting started

The Polaris icons repository contains a set of packages. The packages are all related to each other, so a change to one might necessitate a change to another.
