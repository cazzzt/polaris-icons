# Polaris icons

Polaris icons is the collective name for our new, cohesive, icon system. As part of the wider drive toward cross-platform unity, this system aims to provide internal teams with the iconographic resources they need to work within the new Polaris design system.

Icons within this system are simple and friendly. Each icon is an exercise in distillation, in taking a metaphor and representing its most basic form.

## 1.	Sketch file

The sketch file contains everything within the Polaris icons system. The `Polaris icons` page contains an alphabetically sorted list of icons within the system, split into `major` and `minor` sections for ease of browsing.

The sketch file can be found in Abstract [here](https://share.abstractapp.com/f348c474-832c-4032-8867-4c84286d8666).

_In the vast majority of cases, icons have been designed for a specific use. When using icons, please be sympathetic toward our goal of cohesion and don’t use an icon for a purpose it was not intended for. If you need an icon, please see section 3 below._

## 2.	Major and Minor icons?

Within the system there are 2 distinct icon variants, namely `major` and `minor` icons. While they are part of the same larger system, they differ in design and usage.

### 2a.	Major

Major icons:

* Are `20px` by `20px` in size
* Are primarily composed of strokes
* Have 2 colour variants (monotone and two-tone)

When to use major icons:

* In main navigation in apps, mobile web and web
* To help promote, reinforce, or draw special attention to a specific area or metaphor

Apart from their use in main navigation, major icons are not actionable or clickable.

_In most cases you will use the monotone version of a given icon. The two-tone variant is there for active-states or when specific highlight needs to be given to the icon. Every major icon has 2 variants, regardless of if the two-tone variant has a fill or not._

### 2b. Minor

Minor icons:

* Are `16px` by `16px` in size.
* Are primarily composed of solid shapes.
* Have a single colour variant.

When to use minor icons:

* Inline, usually accompanying text, to add clarity to an action
* In form elements (`<input>`, `<button>`, etc)

## 3.	Expanding the system

Polaris icons will continue to expand just as fast as the rest of the platform, as our needs dictate.

If you’ve identified the need for a specific icon not already present within the icon system, please submit an icon request using the template below:

```
**Name**
Your name

**Slack handle**
@yourslackhandle

**What team / project is this for?**
Your team

**When would you like it by?** 
DD/MM/YYYY

**What's your request? (please include any relevant images, size requirements etc)**?
Description
```

_It is vital that existing icons are not repurposed. Icons are designed, in the vast majority of cases, for a single use. This ensures we don’t start to mix metaphors, and that merchants only ever associate an icon with a single meaning._
