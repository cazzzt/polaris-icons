# Polaris icons: coding contributor's guide

This guide is made for people who want to contribute code to the repository. If you're not comfortable doing that, there's other ways you can help.

## Developing

This package uses [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). That means you have to install sub-package dependencies before you can start developing:

```
yarn
yarn bootstrap
```

## Releasing the library

The release process currently involves some manual steps to complete. Please ping one of the repo owners in the `#polaris-icons` Slack channel when you're ready to merge a new PR into `master`, and we will orchestrate a new release.

**Note** Version numbers in `package.json` files should never be altered manually. This will be done via scripts as part of the release process.

### For repo owners

**Note** these steps require admin access to the `Shopify/polaris-icons` github repo.
