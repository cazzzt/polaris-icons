# Polaris icons: coding contributor's guide

This guide is made for people who want to contribute code to the repository. If you're not comfortable doing that, there's other ways you can help.

## Developing

This package uses [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna). That means you have to install sub-package dependencies before you can start developing:

```
yarn
yarn bootstrap
```

## Deprecation guidelines

Sometimes icons need to be renamed or removed. Both of these actions are breaking changes from a developer's perspective. In order to not erode trust with our consumers and ensure painless update paths we will reduce the impact of these breaking changes by batching them up. Signal your intent to make a breaking change by deprecating an icon like so:

When an icon is deprecated with no replacement (that is, the icon should be deleted in the future): Add `deprecated: true` to the metadata of the icon you intend to remove.

When an icon is deprcated with a replacement (that is, you're renaming an icon): Rename the icon's svgs and metadata file to the new name, then add a `deprecated_aliases` key to the metadata whose value an array of aliases that the icon was previously known as. For instance if you were to rename `foo_major.yml` to `bar_major.yml` then the bottom of the new `bar_major.yml` should contain:

```yml
deprecated_aliases:
  - foo_major
```

This will maintain an export with the original name but mark it as deprecated and instruct consumers to use the new name.

Every 6 months or so, we shall consider releasing a new major version that removes any deprecated icons and aliases.

## Releasing the library

**The npm packages and the gem need to be released at the same time.**

The release process currently involves some manual steps to complete. Please ping one of the repo owners in the `#polaris-icons` Slack channel when you're ready to merge a new PR into `master`, and we will orchestrate a new release.

**Note** Version numbers in `package.json` files should never be altered manually. This will be done via scripts as part of the release process.
